- Let's say we have **E-COMMERECE** application and we have different teams like
- 1. Web application dev
  2. Payment tema
  3. Transactions
  4. DB
  5. API 
- Simple answer is creating a LOGICAL SEPEARTION -- NAMESPACES.
- The challenge is Let's assume all the NS has WORKER NODES, TOTATL WE HAVE 100 CPU's & 100 RAM mib
- Assume we have 5 teams and 5 NS we have created each worker has 20 GB OF CPU AND RAM ( Usually it will be 32gb or 64gb of ram )
- Teams started deploying their services in their NAMESPACE.
- One service or some services in the payment Namespace are LEAKING MEMEORY ( THEY ARE CONSUMING MEMROY MORE THAN REQUIRED FOR SOME REASONS )
- Might application issue or perrformance testing is not done properly, SO IT STARTED USING MOST OF THE RESOURCES IN THE CLUSTER
- USUALLY IT SHOULD TAKE 2GB OF RAM, BUT IT STARTED TAKING MORE RESOUCES LIKE 32 GB RAM.
- DUE TO THIS REASON THE OTHER TEAMS OTHER SERVICES ARE GETTING LESS RESOURCES FROM THE CLUSTER,
- LET'S SAY PAYEMNT NS is TAKING 40GB OF RAM, THEN ALL THE OTHER RESOUCES WILL TAKE 60GB OF RAM FOR REST OF THE 4 NAMESPACE WHICH IS VERY LESS COMPARE TO ACUTAL.
- BECAUSE OF THIS IN API TEAM, SERVICES WILL NOT GET SUFFICENT RESOURCES MIGHT GET CRASHED. MIGHT GET INTO CRASHLOOPBACKUP DUE TO OOMKILLED ISSUE.
- **THIS IS CAN TO FIXED BY PROVIDING PARTICULAR RESOUCES QUOTA LIMIT TO THE NAMESPACE - USING RESOURCE QUOTA**


### SOLUTION
- FOR EACH NS -- WE HAVE USE RESOURCE QUOTA
- IT IS A LIMIT THAT WE APPLY FOR NS
- for example if we set RESOUCE QUOTA TO 15GB FOR NS, Any no of the services in the NS should take 15GB of RAM.
- We can set with respect to CPU AND RAM both
- AS A DEVOPS ENGINEER WE WILL INTERACT WITH DEV TEAMS LIKE WHAT IS THE REQUIRED AMOUNT OF RESOURCES FOR ALL YOUR MICROSERVICES TO RUN
- HOW DEV TEAMS WILL SAY THEY CAN'T TELL DIRECTLY 20 GB, 40 GB LIKE THAT, THEY HAVE TO DO **PERFORMANCE BENCHMARKING** BY USING PERFORMANCE BENCHMARKING THEY HAVE TO COME UP WITH IDEAL NUMBER
- THEN THEY WILL COME UP WITH LIKE WE NEED 20GB OF RAM AND 20GB OF CPU for this NAMESPACE
- NOW EACH NS WILL GET DIFFERNET DIFFERENT RESOURCES QUOTA Like NS 1 required 20GB, NS 2 may required only 10GB.
- ALL THE NAMESPACES SHOULD NOT EXCEED 100GB, IF DEV TEAMS ARE ASKING MORE AND THEY DID PEROFRMANCE BEANCHMARKING AS PER ORG STANDARDS THEY WE HAVE TO ALLOCATED THEM RESOURCE BY SCALING THE CLUSTER
- PROBABLY WE HAVE TO ADD OTHER WORKER NODE AND MAKE SURE ALL THE SERVICES ARE RUNNING SMOTHLY.
